# weather-api 
The API is only a Minimal API, I did choose this one because the project is simple. .Net 6

The backend part has 6 layers plus a unit test layer and integration test layers.

Looking at the project I can see some improvements and some downgrades to set things more simple.

Front-end is my first project with React, so I spent a lot of time reading about how to start and with simple things, but there he is.
